# 2D-xtDCR-LTBEM

2D-xtDCR-LTBEM is a Fortran-based program that can be used to find numerical solutions of two-dimensional (2D) initial-boundary value problems, which are governed by a class of unsteady anisotropic-diffusion convection reaction (DCR) equations of space-time dependent coefficients, by utilizing a combined Laplace Transform-Boundary Element Method (LTBEM). This program may provide valuable help for simulation of problems of Functionally Graded Materials (FGM).
